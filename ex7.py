# Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
# Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
# From now on, when you make mistakes, 
# write down on a piece of paper what kind of mistake you made.
# When you go to the next exercise, 
# look at the mistakes you have made and try not to make them in this new one.
# Remember that everyone makes mistakes. 
# Programmers are like magicians who fool everyone into thinking they are perfect 
# and never wrong, but it's all an act. They make mistakes all the time.
