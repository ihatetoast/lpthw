Originally a repo for Learn Python the Hard Way, I have added folders for classes I have taken on Python

* folder Python-katas are snippets from working through CodeWars
* playground is obvi
* capital_quiz
    - is in Py 3
    - longer because v basic (ie 50 states = 50 inputs = 50 check_guess
    - keeping long b/c this is for BEFORE kids know loops
    - use as example of why and how looping saves us 
    - 50 also helps the kids learn caps and hammers in basics of input and calling fcn with args
    - easily converted to py 2)
